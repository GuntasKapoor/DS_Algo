# Data Structures and Algorithms

This Repository contains all the codes I have written while learning Data Structure and Algorithms.
All the codes are in C++ and are commented and the Question is also specified in the comments.
Feel free to clone and do solve the problems by yourself. The Source from where the Questions is taken is also Mentioned.Also to mention that the repository contains executable files also with the cpp code. So to run the code on your system clone the reository and compile and run the .cc file on your IDE or using Terminal (compile using g++ filename.cc and run using ./a.out).
