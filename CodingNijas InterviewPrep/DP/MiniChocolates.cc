// Noor is a teacher. She wants to give some chocolates to the students in her class. 
// All the students sit in a line and each of them has a score according to performance. Noor wants to give at least 
// 1 chocolate to each student. She distributes chocolates to them such that If two students sit next to each other then the one with the higher 
// score must get more chocolates. Noor wants to save money, so she wants to minimise the total number of chocolates.
// Note that when two students have equal score they are allowed to have different number of chocolates.
